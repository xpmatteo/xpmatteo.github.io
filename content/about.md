All the opinions expressed here are my own and not of my employer.

I&nbsp;am a software developer, keen on understanding what helps organizations create excellent results with software.

I pursued [a Ph.D. thesis](/matteo-vaccari-calculational-derivation-of-circuits.pdf) on how to write programs (actually circuits) that are [correct by construction, using mathematical techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_derivation "Program derivation - Wikipedia"); my supervisors were [Roland Backhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Carl_Backhouse "Roland Carl Backhouse - Wikipedia") and the late [Pierangelo Miglioli](http://www.dista.uninsubria.it/~ferram/_static/pierangelo/index.html "Pierangelo Miglioli / Biography").  A few years later I found that [Test-Driven Development](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/canon-tdd "") answers the correctness needs I felt better than mathematical derivation.

I&nbsp;was lucky to be exposed to [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/ "Extreme Programming: A Gentle Introduction.") early enough in my career.  I&nbsp;helped organize [three summer schools](http://essap.dicom.uninsubria.it/) about agility, thanks to the help of my friend [Federico Gobbo](https://federicogobbo.name/ "Federico Gobbo") and the late Professor [Elio Lanzarone](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274151092_Elio_Lanzarone_A_life_for_science "Elio Lanzarone: A life for science"). I&nbsp;was, and still am to some extent, active in [the agile community](https://agilemovement.it/ "Italian Agile Movement").

I&nbsp;used to be a strong supporter of Ruby On Rails, but I&nbsp;then changed my mind about both Rails and Ruby.  Today I&nbsp;think that Java, Go or Python are better engineering tools than Ruby.  

I&nbsp;think that application frameworks in general make little engineering sense; I&nbsp;maintain the [Awesome Frameworkless](https://github.com/frameworkless-movement/awesome-frameworkless "A collection of awesome things regarding Frameworkless").

I&nbsp;love the [Web](https://www.w3.org/ "W3C") as a platform; I&nbsp;think the best way to develop for the Web is to embrace its fundamental standards: URLs, HTML and CSS. Application frameworks that take away control about URLs and HTML from the developer (eg, Apache Wicket or Java Server Faces) are almost always a bad idea, as they generate websites that perform poorly and are bad Web citizens. Moreover, I&nbsp;think that JavaScript application frameworks are engineering disasters, leading to websites that cost a lot of money to build and maintain, become obsolete very quickly, perform poorly and are bad Web citizens.  

Generating websites from server-side templates costs a fraction of a JavaScript <abbr title="Single-Page Application">SPA</abbr> and can be made fast and more interactive with nimble libraries such as [htmx](https://htmx.org/ "&lt;&#x2F;&gt; htmx - high power tools for html").

#### Colophon

This website is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ "The world’s fastest framework for building websites | Hugo"), using the [Hugo-Simple](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-simple/ "Hugo Simple | Hugo Themes") theme; it's hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages | Websites for you and your projects, hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.").  I&nbsp;used to host a [Wordpress-based](https://wordpress.com/ "WordPress.com: Build a Site, Sell Your Stuff, Start a Blog &amp; More") blog at <a href="/blog">/blog</a>; however I&nbsp;then fed up with the need to maintain a database and a Linux server, so I&nbsp;dumped all the pages with [httrack](https://www.httrack.com/ "HTTrack Website Copier - Free Software Offline Browser (GNU GPL)") and replaced the Wordpress blog with a static copy.  My new blog is managed with Hugo at <a href="/posts">/posts</a>. I&nbsp;still write the contents of this blog with [TextMate](https://macromates.com/ "TextMate: Text editor for macOS"), out of nostalgia&nbsp;:-). Actually, TextMate works pretty well for authoring Markdown and HTML.

My previous teaching career was supported by websites at [/so](/so), [/aw](/aw), [/tai](/tai), generated with a bunch of Ruby scripts. In 2021 I&nbsp;dropped Ruby and replaced those websites with static copies, generated with httrack.
