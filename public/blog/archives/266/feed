					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely have to raise some money for a F. Cirillo&#039;s workshop :-)
However, I think that it&#039;s really easy to end up in a E-R-oriented programming (at least for me),
depending on what type of application you&#039;re building (web development for instance...I&#039;m also thinking about Rails or Active Record pattern in general).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Francesco Cirillo&#039;s workshop on emergent design is a big part of it.  But it&#039;s not just that isolated incident; many sources that I like and trust point in that direction.  Like Misko Hevery, Robert Martin, Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.  The hexagonal architecture as well.  And the fact that now that I know a bit more about objects I see that I&#039;m getting better in writing code that can be easily extended.]]></description>
