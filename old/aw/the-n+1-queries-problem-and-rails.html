    <h1>The N+1 Queries Problem and Rails</h1>

<p>The “N+1 queries” is a common performance problem that can happen when we deal with an entity that has an association to another.  For instance, a Tweet <code>belongs_to</code> an User and <code>has_many</code> Comments.  When we display a page with all Tweets we might use</p>

<pre><code>@tweets = Tweet.all
</code></pre>

<p>And then in the template we might call</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% for tweet in @tweets %&gt;
&lt;div class="tweet"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= tweet.text %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= tweet.user.name %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You might guess that we are performing a first query to find the tweets, and then an additional query for finding the user of every tweet we found.  We can see that from the Rails log:</p>

<pre><code>Started GET "/" for 127.0.0.1 at 2013-01-18 13:15:43 +0100
Processing by TweetsController#index as HTML
  Tweet Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "tweets".* FROM "tweets" ORDER BY created_at desc
  User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" IN (10, 9)
  User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 10]]
  CACHE (0.0ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 10]]
  CACHE (0.0ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 10]]
  CACHE (0.0ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 10]]
  CACHE (0.0ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 10]]
  User Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 9]]
  CACHE (0.0ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 9]]
  CACHE (0.0ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 9]]
  CACHE (0.0ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 9]]
  Rendered shared/_tweets.html.erb (6.4ms)
  Rendered tweets/index.html.erb within layouts/application (8.9ms)
Completed 200 OK in 65ms (Views: 11.3ms | ActiveRecord: 1.6ms)
</code></pre>

<p>This is obviously bad for performance.  <strong>It's much more efficient to issue one (or two) big queries than many small queries</strong>.  One idea would be to select from a join of tweets with users (one query).  Another idea is to first select all the tweets, than inspect which <code>user_ids</code> they contain, and then issue a second query for all the users with id in the ids that we found earlier (two queries in all).</p>

<p>ActiveRecord (which is Rails object-relational mapping library) offers a very convenient way to solve the problem.  Whenever we issue a query for an array of entities, and we know that we are going to ask those entities for an associated entity, we can use the "includes" clause.  For instance</p>

<pre><code>@tweets = Tweet.includes("user").all
</code></pre>

<p>After this change, we can observe what happens in the Rails log:</p>

<pre><code>Started GET "/" for 127.0.0.1 at 2013-01-18 16:35:48 +0100
Processing by TweetsController#index as HTML
  Tweet Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "tweets".* FROM "tweets" ORDER BY created_at desc
  User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" IN (10, 11, 9)
  Rendered shared/_tweets.html.erb (4.4ms)
  Rendered tweets/index.html.erb within layouts/application (7.6ms)
Completed 200 OK in 15ms (Views: 10.8ms | ActiveRecord: 0.7ms)
</code></pre>

<p>Much better! We can see that ActiveRecord chose the "two queries" option.</p>

<p>The choice to use a join or two separate queries depends on the particular case; in general the join is <em>less</em> efficient but not always.  In general it is easier to get reasonable performance out of two simple queries than a complex one.  Usually it's best to let ActiveRecord choose.  In rare cases ActiveRecord's choice might not be good; in those rare case we can code the SQL by hand.</p>

<p>Please note that THIS IS NOT A RAILS-SPECIFIC PROBLEM!  Every object-relational technology has this problem.  Rails happens to solve it in a very convenient way.</p>
