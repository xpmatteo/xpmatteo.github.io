					<description><![CDATA[Hi Matteo, These are really nice examples, and definitely help to clarify Kent&#039;s explanations and approach.

In the logfile example (having also done it myself several times :), my first cut is to check that I can summarize the input correctly. So one column first, with increasing complexity in the file. Only then would I think about splitting out the other columns.

Keep up the great writing -- thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hei Matteo, 

while many are in hurry to voice their opinions or criticize someone else ideas is fascinating to see that still exist people that is willing to first understand.

I haven&#039;t found it easy from the video to really get the definitions of all the design strategies Kent Beck described.

Following this link you find also the slides, this helped me a little, still I&#039;m not sure I perfectly understood Kent ideas:

I&#039;m eager to read more post from you about this argument. A second point of view will help me for sure.]]></description>
