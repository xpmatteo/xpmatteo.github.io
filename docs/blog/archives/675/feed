					<description><![CDATA[Well I think all the DDD movement is the best place to discuss how to map OO on domain.
I also disagree with the recipe: “take the description of your problem, underline the nouns in the description, and these are your candidate objects”
I tried in the past and the result were orrible distribuited logic and god classes.
We need a maieutic approach in extracting objects from specification as Evans said.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;[..] It was a community of software agents, each one specialized in some symbolic solution technique, that worked at the problem without any central coordination [..]&quot;


Here it comes a funny story.
 
I was wearing my &quot;Anti-IF campaign&quot; shirt (the one from Cirillo), and a friend of mine just asked &quot;why polymorphism?&quot; (stated on the back of the shirt). she studies chemistry and biology, so she was wondering if &quot;my polymorphism&quot; was related in any way with &quot;her polymorphosm&quot;: a property of cells, which can potentially act in many ways.

And the answer is: yes! 

&quot;[..] It&#039;s object-oriented programming. [..] I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages [..]&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[Seaside is certainly great stuff (even though it goes straight against my intuition about how web applications should work!)  But I said that *SmallTalk* itself stopped evolving in 1980.  If I&#039;m not mistaken (I don&#039;t know for sure) Squeak and Pharo are essentially reimplementation of the same language.

Alan Kay himself says, in his OOPSLA video The Computer Revolution Hasn&#039;t Started Yet, that from 1970 to 1980 SmallTalk was reinvented every two years, but when they published SmallTalk-80 to the world, everyone thought &quot;hey, this is SmallTalk, let&#039;s learn it&quot; rather than &quot;let&#039;s reinvent it&quot; !

For instance, one fun thing Kay mentions in the Early History of SmallTalk is that he likes that in Prolog, even variables are objects that exhibit specific behaviours.  This is a sample of what he means when he says that a key ingredient of OO is having access to meta-levels all the way through!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, Matteo.

I agree 99.99% -- the fundamentals of OOAD are certainly far more useful than any technology-specific stuff.

On the Smalltalk side, I also started toying with it (you know, Davide?) and a new world opened to me. But when you see a young guy like Avy Bryant releasing great stuff like Seaside, how can you say that Smalltalk development ended in the 80s? :-) (yes, this is the 0.01% bit missing!)

					<description><![CDATA[Great Matteo, i reach the same results without have your experience. In my opinion the key is A NEW WAY OF THINKING, a NEW mindset. the collaboration diagram of the cirillo&#039;s workshop is not only a WAY for learn to think :D?]]></description>
