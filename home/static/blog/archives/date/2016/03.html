				<small>Tuesday, March 29th, 2016</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>When you are developing a complex application, be it web, mobile or whatever, it&#8217;s useful to be able to <strong>launch any screen immediately and independently</strong> from the rest of the system.  By &#8220;screen&#8221; I mean a web page, an Android activity, a Swing component, or whatever it is called in the UI technology that you are using.  For instance, in an ecommerce application, I would like to be able to immediately show the &#8220;thank you for your purchase&#8221; page, without going through logging in, adding an item to the cart and paying.  </p>
<p>The benefits of this simple idea are many:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can easily demo user stories that are related to that screen</li>
<li>You can quickly test UI changes</li>
<li>You can debug things related to that page</li>
<li>You can spike variations</li>
<li>The design of the screen is cleaner and less expensive to maintain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, teams are often not able to do this, because screens are tightly coupled to the rest of the application.  For instance, in Javascript single-page applications, it would be good to be able to launch a view without having to start a server. Often this is not possible, because the view is tightly coupled to the Ajax code that gets the data from the server, that the view needs to function.</p>
<p>The way out of this problem is to decouple the screen from its data sources.  In a web application, I would launch a screen by going to a debug page that allows me to set up some test data, and then launch the page.  For instance:</p>
<p><img src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Untitled-2.png" alt="Untitled 2" style='width: 60%' /></p>
<p>Note that the form starts pre-populated with default data, so that I can launch the desired screen with a single click.</p>
<p>Making screens decoupled from their data sources does, in my opinion, generally improve the design of the application.  Making things more testable has a general positive impact on quality.</p>

				<h3 id="post-972"><a href="../../972.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Bureaucratic tests">Bureaucratic tests</a></h3>
				<small>Monday, March 28th, 2016</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The TDD cycle should be fast!  We should be able to repeat the red-green-refactor cycle every few minutes.  This means that we should work in very small steps.  Kent Beck in fact is always talking about &#8220;baby steps.&#8221;  So we should learn how to make progress towards our goal in very small steps, each one taking us a little bit further.  Great!  How do we do that?</p>
<h3 id="example_1_testing_that_8220it8217s_an_object8221">Example 1: Testing that &#8220;it&#8217;s an object&#8221;</h3>
<p>In the quest for &#8220;small steps&#8221;, I sometimes see recommendations that we write things like these:</p>
<pre><code>it("should be an object", function() {
  assertThat(typeof chat.userController === 'object')
});
</code></pre>
<p>which, of course, we can pass by writing</p>
<pre><code>chat.userController = {}
</code></pre>
<p>What is the next &#8220;baby step&#8221;?</p>
<pre><code>it("should be a function", function() {
  assertThat(typeof chat.userController.login === 'function')
});
</code></pre>
<p>And, again, it&#8217;s very easy to make this pass.</p>
<pre><code>chat.userController = { login: function() {} }
</code></pre>
<p>I think these are <strong>not the right kind of &#8220;baby steps&#8221;</strong>.  These tests give us very little value.</p>
<p>Where is the value in a test?  In my view, a test gives you two kinds of value:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verification value, where I get assurance that the code does what I expect.  This is the tester&#8217;s perspective.</li>
<li>Design feedback, where I get information on the quality of my design.  And this is the programmers&#8217;s perspective.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that in the previous two tests, we didn&#8217;t get any verification value, as all we were checking is the behaviour of the <code>typeof</code> operator.  And we didn&#8217;t get any design feedback either.  We checked that we have an object with a method; this does not mean much, because any problem can be solved with objects and methods.  It&#8217;s a bit like judging a book by checking that it contains written words.  What matters is what the words mean.  In the case of software, what matters is what the objects do.</p>
<h3 id="example_2_testing_ui_structure">Example 2: Testing UI structure</h3>
<p>Another example: there are tutorials that suggest that we test an Android&#8217;s app UI with tests like this one:</p>
<pre><code>public void testMessageGravity() throws Exception {
  TextView myMessage = 
    (TextView) getActivity().findViewById(R.id.myMessage);
  assertEquals(Gravity.CENTER, myMessage.getGravity());
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which, of course, can be made to pass by adding one line to a UI XML file:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;TextView
  android:id="@+id/myMessage"
  <strong>android:gravity="center"</strong>
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>What have we learned from this test?  Not much, I&#8217;m afraid.</p>
<h3 id="example_3_testing_a_listener">Example 3: Testing a listener</h3>
<p>This last example is sometimes seen in GUI/MVC code.  We are developing a screen of some sort, and we try to make progress towards the goal of &#8220;when I click this button, something interesting happens.&#8221;  So we write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void buttonShouldBeConnectedToAction() {
    assertEquals(button.getActionListeners().length, 1);
    assertTrue(button.getActionListeners()[0] 
                 instanceof ActionThatDoesSomething);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, this test does not give us much value.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>The above tests are all examples of what Keith Braithwaithe calls &#8220;pseudo-TDD&#8221;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Think of a solution</li>
<li>Imagine a bunch of classes and functions that you just know you’ll need to implement (1)</li>
<li>Write some tests that assert the existence of (2)</li>
<li>[&#8230; go read <a href="https://cumulative-hypotheses.org/2011/08/30/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it/">Keith&#8217;s article</a> for the rest of his thoughts on the subject.]</li>
</ol>
<p>In all of the above examples, we start by thinking of a line of production code that we want to write.  Then we write a test that asserts that that line of code exists.  This test does nothing but <strong>give us permission</strong> to write that line of code: it&#8217;s just bureaucracy!  </p>
<p>Then we write the line of code, and the test passes. What have we accomplished?  A false sense of progress; a false sense of &#8220;doing the right thing&#8221;.  In the end, all we did was wasting time.  </p>
<p>Sometimes I hear developers claim that they took longer to finish, because they had to write the tests.  To me, this is nonsense: I write tests to go faster, not slower.  Writing useless tests slows me down.  If I feel that testing makes me slower, I should probably reconsider how I write those tests: I&#8217;m probably writing bureaucratic tests.</p>
<h3 id="valuable_tests">Valuable tests</h3>
<p>Bureaucratic tests are about <strong>testing a bit of solution</strong> (that is, a bit of the implementation of a solution).  Valuable test are about <strong>solving a little bit of the problem</strong>.  Bureaucratic tests are usually testing structure; valuable tests are always about testing behaviour.  The right way to do baby steps is to break down <strong>the problem</strong> in small bits (not the solution).  If you want to do useful baby steps, start by writing a list of all the tests that you think you will need.</p>
<p>In <em>Test-Driven Development: by Example</em>, Kent Beck attacks the problem of implementing multi-currency money starting with this to-do list:</p>
<pre><code>$5 + 10 CHF = $10 if rate is 2:1
$5 * 2 = $10
</code></pre>
<p>Note that these tests are nothing but small slices of the problem.  In the course of developing the solution, many more tests are added to the list.</p>
<p>Now you are probably wonder what would I do, instead of the bureaucratic tests that I presented above.  In each case, I would start with a simple example of what the software should do.  What are the responsibilities of the <code>userController</code>?  Start there.  For instance:</p>
<pre><code>it("logs in an existing user", function() {
  var user = { nickname: "pippo", password: "s3cr3t" }
  chat.userController.addUser user

  expect(chat.userController.login("pippo", "s3cr3t")).toBe(user)
});
</code></pre>
<p>In the case of the Android UI, I would probably test it by looking at it; the looks of the UI have no behaviour that I can test with logic.  My test passes when the UI &#8220;looks OK&#8221;, and that I can only test by looking at it (see also <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/03/06/ThePragmaticsOfTDD.html">Robert Martin&#8217;s opinion on when not to TDD</a>).  I suppose that some of it can be automated with <a href='http://www.agileday.it/2015/sessions/snapshot-testing-su-ios/'>snapshot testing</a>, which is a variant of the &#8220;golden master&#8221; technique.</p>
<p>In the case of the GUI button listener, I would not test it directly.  I would probably write an end-to-end test that proves that when I click the button, something interesting happens.  I would probably also have more focused tests on the behaviour that is being invoked by the listener.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Breaking down a problem into baby steps means that we break in very small pieces the problem to solve, not the solution.  Our tests should always speak about bits of the problem; that is, about things that the customer actually asked for.  Sometimes we need to start by solving an arbitrarily simplified version of the original problem, like Kent Beck and Bill Wake do in <a href='http://xp123.com/articles/slicing-functionality-alternate-paths/'>this article I found enlightening</a>; but it&#8217;s always about testing the problem, not the solution!</p>

				<h3 id="post-963"><a href="../../963.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to OOP is underrated">OOP is underrated</a></h3>
				<small>Monday, March 21st, 2016</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I came recently upon a thread where Object-Oriented Programming was being questioned because of excessive complexity, ceremony, layers,&#8230; and because of the insistence of OOP of treating everything as an object, which some feel runs counter to most people&#8217;s intuition.  Similar threads keep appearing, where OOP is being questioned and other approaches, like functional programming, are seen as a cure for the OOP &#8220;problem&#8221;.</p>
<p>My answer touches upon many points, and I wanted to share it with you.</p>
<p>Encapsulation is a key thing in OOP, and it&#8217;s just part of the larger context.  Abstract Data Types also do encapsulation.  OOP is more than that; the key idea is that OOP enables the building of a model of the problem you want to solve; and that model is reasoned about with the spatial, verbal and operational reasoning modes that we all use to solve everyday problems.  In this sense OOP culture is strongly different from the ADT and formal math culture.</p>
<p>Math is very powerful.  It enables to solve problems that by intuition alone you wouldn&#8217;t be able to solve easily.  A good mathematical model can make simple what seems to be very complex.  Think how Fourier transforms make it easy to reason about signals.  Think how a little mathematical reasoning makes it easy to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_chessboard_problem">Mutilated Chessboard problem</a>.  In fact, a good mathematical model can reduce the essential complexity of a problem.  (You read right &#8212; reducing the essential complexity.  I think that we are never sure what the essential complexity of a problem really is.  There might always be another angle or an insight to be had that would make it simpler than what we thought it was.  Think a parallel with Kolmogorov complexity: you never know what the K complexity of a string really is.)</p>
<p>However, mathematical reasoning is difficult and rare.  If you can use it, then more power to you!  My feeling is that many recent converts to FP fail to see the extent of the power of mathematical models and limit themselves to using FP as a fancy procedural language.  But I digress.</p>
<p>My point is that if you want to reach the point of agile maturity where programming is no longer the bottleneck, and we deliver when the market is ready, not when we finally manage to finish coding (two stars on <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html">the Shore/Larsen model</a>), building the right model of the problem is an essential ingredient.  You should build a model that is captured as directly as possible in code.  If you have a mathematical model, it&#8217;s probably a good fit for a functional programming language.  However, we don&#8217;t always have a good mathematical model of our problems.</p>
<p>For many problems, we can more readily find spatial/verbal/operational intuitive models.  When we describe an OO model with phrases like &#8220;This guy talks to that guy&#8221;, that is the sort of description that made <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD936.html">Dijkstra fume with disdain</a>!  Yet this way of reasoning is simple, immediate and useful.  Some kind of problems readily adapt themselves to be modeled this way.  You may think of it as programming a simulation of the problem.  It leverages a part of our brain that (unlike mathematical reasoning) we all use all the time.  These operational models, while arguably less powerful than mathematical models, are easier reason about and to communicate.</p>
<p>Coming to the perception of the excessive &#8220;ceremony&#8221; and &#8220;layers&#8221; of OOP, I have two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most &#8220;OOP&#8221; that we see is not OOP at all.  Most programs are conceived starting with the data schema.  That&#8217;s the opposite of OOP!  If you want to do OOP, you start with the behaviour that is visible from the outside of your system, not with the data that lie within it.  It&#8217;s too bad that most programming culture is so deeply data-oriented that we don&#8217;t even realise this.  It&#8217;s too bad that a lot of framework and tooling imply and push towards data centric: think JPA and Rails-style ActiveRecord, where you design your &#8220;object&#8221; model as a tightly-coupled copy of a data model.</li>
<li>
Are we practicing XP?  When we practice XP, we introduce stuff gradually as we need.  An abstraction is introduced when there is a concrete need.  A layer is introduced when it is shown to simplify the existing program.  When we introduce layers and framework upfront (anybody here do a &#8220;framework selection meeting&#8221; before starting coding? :-) ) we usually end up with extra complexity.  But that&#8217;s nothing new: XP has been teaching us to avoid upfront design for a long time.
</li>
</ol>
<p>For more on how OOP thinking differs from formalist thinking, see <a href="https://books.google.it/books/about/Object_Thinking.html?id=-eJQAAAAMAAJ">Object Thinking</a> by David West.  I also did a presentation on this subject (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6Z3wOdfWc">video in Italian</a>).</p>
