    <p>The “N+1 queries” is a common performance problem that can happen when we deal with an entity that has a one-to-many relation to another.  For instance, a Quote has-many Comments.  When we display a page with all quotes we might use</p>

<pre><code>def find_all_quotes(category_id)
  quotes = db_select
    "select * from quotes where category_id = #{category_id} limit 100"
  for quote in quotes
    quote[:comments] = db_select 
        "select * from comments where quote_id = #{quote.id}"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>You see that we are performing a first query to find the quotes, and then an additional query for every quote we found.  This is obviously bad for performance.  <strong>It's much more efficient to issue a single big query than many small queries</strong>.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>def find_all_quotes(category_id)
  quotes = db_select 
    "select * from quotes where category_id = #{category_id} order by quote_id limit 100"
  comments = db_select 
    "select * from comments where quote_id in " +
    "(select quote_id from quotes where category_id = #{category_id} limit 100)" 
  # loop through results and attach each comment to its quote
  # ... 
end
</code></pre>

<p>An alternative way would be to use a join like</p>

<pre><code>select * from quotes q, comments c 
where c.quote_id = q.quote_id
  and category_id = #{category_id}
</code></pre>

<p>The choice to use a join or two separate queries depends on the particular case; in general the join is <em>less</em> efficient but not always.</p>

<p>In both cases some work must be done after the queries are done.  The query results must be fixed so that the result of the <code>find_all_quotes</code> function is an array of quotes where each quote contains an array of comments.  This is not a significant overhead, compared to doing N+1 queries.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> in these examples we assume that <code>category_id</code> was previously cleaned to protect us from SQL injection attacks.</p>
